# Configuration File for Tenbilac
# WARNING: ConfigParser configuration files are surprisingly weird for newbies:
# - Comment only on separate lines
# - Leave a field blank AND REMOVE THE ":" to specify "None"
# - But the latter only works if a string was expected, not for floats, ints, ...

[setup]

# Pick a name for your training run (e.g. net55). 
# Leave it blank and the filename of the present config file will be used instead -- this is the recommended use.
